# FaultDetector.NET - Visual Studio Add-in

**FaultDetector.NET** is an automated fault localization tool designed for C# projects, integrated directly into Visual Studio 2022. This add-in helps developers identify potential fault locations in their code by analyzing test results and generating a ranking of suspicious code lines.


### Key Features:
- **Seamless Visual Studio Integration**: Fully integrated into Visual Studio 2022, allowing developers to interact directly within their familiar environment.
- **Multiple Fault Localization Techniques**: Supports a wide variety of spectrum-based fault localization techniques.
- **Coverage Matrix Visualization**: Displays a detailed matrix that highlights the coverage of each line of code during test execution.
- **Suspiciousness Ranking**: The tool provides a ranked list of the most suspicious lines of code based on the selected fault localization technique, helping to quickly pinpoint potential bugs.


### Installation

1. Open Visual Studio 2022.
2. Go to the menu `Extensions > Manage Extensions`.
3. Search for `FaultDetector.NET` in the search bar.
4. Install the extension and restart Visual Studio.
